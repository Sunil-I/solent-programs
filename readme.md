# Installing Java
This is a short introduction on how to install Java on your personal machine.

### Personal Machine
We have more freedom here since we have Admin rights, you will want to move the jdk-11 folder to `C:\Program Files\Java`. Once you have done, so you will want to make an environment variable in `PATH` to include the location of maven's bin folder e.g `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11\bin`

```
1) git clone --branch java https://github.com/Sunil-I/solent-programs jdk-11
2) unzip both part-1 and part-2 and delete the zip files so everything should be in one folder and not part-1/part-2
3) Move jdk-11 to C:\Program Files\Java
4) Set up an enviroment variable in PATH to include C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11
```
